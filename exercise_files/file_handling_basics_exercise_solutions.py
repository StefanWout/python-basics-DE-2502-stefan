# Exercise 1 Solution:

file1 = 'data.txt'                   # will raise FileNotFoundError
# file1 = 'demo_files/data.txt'      # should print the file contents

try:
    with open(file1, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()
        print(content)
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("Error: The file 'data.txt' was not found.")

# Exercise 2 Solution:
# This file will automatically be created in the current directory
# if it does not exist!

lines = [
    "Line 1: Hello, world!",
    "Line 2: Python file handling.",
    "Line 3: Goodbye!"
]

    for line in lines:
        file.write(line + "\n")

# Exercise 3 Solution:
# You will need to create the text file for this exercise!

# Exercise 4 Solution:

file4 = 'data_with_error.csv'                # will raise FileNotFoundError
# file4 = 'demo_files/data_with_error.csv'     # will raise ValueError

try:
